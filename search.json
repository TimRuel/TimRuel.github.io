Proficient in utilizing R and Python for data wrangling and implementing machine learning techniques.\nI am currently in my fifth year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. My research focuses on developing a novel algorithm for the numerical approximation of integrated likelihood functions. This innovative approach aims to eliminate nuisance parameters from statistical models, providing scientific researchers with a tool to facilitate the estimation of the parameters of interest in their studies."
