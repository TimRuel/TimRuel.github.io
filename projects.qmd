The 'generalizeR' is an R package implementation of the webtool [thegeneralizer.org](https://www.thegeneralizer.org/). Its purpose is to guide primary and secondary education researchers (K-12) through the process of (1) designing a sample recruitment plan with generalization in mind and (2) reporting where the results of a study may (or may not) generalize well.
