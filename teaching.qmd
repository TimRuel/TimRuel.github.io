Since beginning my Ph.D. program, I have assisted with teaching nine courses in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. 

During this time, my responsibilities have included:

- Holding office hours 
- Leading discussion sections
- Proctoring exams
- Grading homework assignments, labs, and exams 

I am currently a teaching assistant for *STAT 301-2 Data Science II with R*.
