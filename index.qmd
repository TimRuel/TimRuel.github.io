## About Me

Inquisitive data scientist interested in using my statistical expertise to build models, make predictions, and solve real-world problems with data. Experienced in using R and Python for data wrangling and machine learning.

Currently I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. My research involves developing a novel algorithm for the numerical approximation of integrated likelihood functions as a means of eliminating nuisance parameters from a statistical model.
