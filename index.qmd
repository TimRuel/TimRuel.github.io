## About Me

Enthusiastic data scientist with a passion for leveraging statistical expertise to construct models, formulate predictions, and address real-world challenges through the power of data. Proficient in utilizing R and Python for data wrangling and implementing machine learning techniques.

I am currently in my fifth year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. My research focuses on developing a novel algorithm for the numerical approximation of integrated likelihood functions. This innovative approach aims to eliminate nuisance parameters from statistical models, providing scientific researchers with a tool to facilitate the estimation of the parameters of interest in their studies.
