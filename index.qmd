I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern
University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). My research involves using Bayesian ideas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo to develop new methods and applications for approximating pseudolikelihood functions.
